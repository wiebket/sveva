# A Data Perspective on Ethical Challenges in Voice Biometrics Research

## About this work

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook accompanying the scientific paper titled "A Data Perspective on Ethical Challenges in Voice Biometrics Research". 
Through a longitudinal study of nearly 700 papers, we investigate the evolution of dataset usage in speaker recognition. Our analysis reveals trends, patterns, and shifts in data practices. We highlight the dominance of certain datasets and discuss ethical implications. 
The notebook provides the metadata analysis and visualization for four key datasets (Switchboard, Mixer, VoxCeleb, and ASVspoof).
